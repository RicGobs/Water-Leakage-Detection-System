# Problem
Today irrigation is still handled in some cases with manual activation of water valves. On the other hand, watering automation is often a simple standard neither keeping into account the effective needs of the soil nor possible water leaks from watering pipes. This superficial management is leading to a huge waste of water, which is one of main causes of drought.
