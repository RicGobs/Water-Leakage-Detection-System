# Concept

## Problem

Today irrigation does often not keep into account possible water leaks from watering pipes. This superficial management is leading to a huge waste of water, which is one of main causes of drought.

## Proposed solution

Our proposed solution consists of an interface through which it is possible to monitor the irrigation system. The user can know if a leakage is detected and where it is located, as well as the flow of water at the source site. Another available information is the past water usage schedule, with the relative periodical measurements of water flows.

## Use cases

Our system allows to do the following tasks:

* Leakages detection, quantification and localization
* Water usage monitoring
