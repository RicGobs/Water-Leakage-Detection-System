# Irrigation Water Leakage System

## Description

Our project is designed to offer some smart functionalities to an irrigation system. Our main goal is to keep track of water usage and leakages, in order to avoid the waste of water. In detail, the system provides measurements about water flow at the source and it detects possible water leakages through irrigation pipes, triggering a proper alarm.

[Concept](https://github.com/simonescaccia/Irrigation-Water-Leakage-System/blob/main/Concept.md) provides details from the user perspective, while [Design](https://github.com/simonescaccia/Irrigation-Water-Leakage-System/blob/main/Design.md) provides technical details about the project. Finally, [Evaluation](https://github.com/simonescaccia/Irrigation-Water-Leakage-System/blob/main/Evaluation.md) focuses on performance issues.
