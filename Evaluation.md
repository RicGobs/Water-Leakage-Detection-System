# Evaluation

## Performance evaluation

### During the development of the project

General performance evaluation of the system:
We want to detect if a water leak occur within 24h, in order to be able to repair it the next working day and I can reduce the water loss. Also, we want to know wich pipe is leaking.

We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of the system:

1. Leak is dectected within 24h
2. The pipe is correctly identified

### When the first complete version of the system will be ready for use

We want to detect if a water leak occur within 24h, in order to be able to repair it the next working day and I can reduce the water loss. Also, we want to know wich pipe is leaking, providing information about the quantity of water leaks in a second.

1. Leak is dectected within 24h
2. The pipe is correctly identified
3. The quantity of water leaked with an accuracy of 95% (sensor precision error)
