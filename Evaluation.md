# Evaluation

## Performance evaluation

### During the development of the project

General performance evaluation of the system:
We want to detect if a water leak occur within 24h, in order to be able to repair it the next working day so that we can reduce water loss. Also, we want to know wich pipe is leaking.

We will use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of the system:

1. Leak is dectected within 24h
2. The pipe is correctly identified

### When the first complete version of the system will be ready for use

We will want to detect if a water leak occur within 24h, in order to be able to repair it the next working day so that we can reduce water loss. Also, we want to know wich pipe is leaking, providing information about the quantity of water leakage in a second.

1. Leak is dectected within 24h
2. The pipe is correctly identified
3. The quantity of water leaked with an accuracy of 95% (sensor precision error)

## Evaluation methodology

### Individual Components
(CHIEF, FORK, BRANCH)
We wish to evaluate the power consumption of MCUs that are not attached to a power cord, so for the FORK and the BRANCH MCUs. Our goal is to make the batteries last for 1 year. For the CHIEF MCUs, we want to evaluate the balancing of load of requests, in particular when scaling the system. Needed metrics will be respectively the number of Wh and the average number of requests per hour.
