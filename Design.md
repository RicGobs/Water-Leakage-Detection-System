Cloud system (AWS) to collect and store tracking data <br/>
Electrovalve <br/>
Water flow sensor <br/>
Temperature humidity sensor <br/>

Cloud storage
The tagged and aggregated data is stored on AWS for long term storage. This data can then be queried by operators in order to gain insights on the movement of cargo within the port, such as:

Areas with high congestion
Long routes
Shipment errors
Frontend
An interactive dashboard will provide a way to visualize the data over the port area and to query it as needed.
