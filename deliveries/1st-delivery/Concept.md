# Problem
Today irrigation is still handled in some cases with manual activation of water valves. On the other hand, watering automation is often a simple standard neither keeping into account the effective needs of the soil nor possible water leaks from watering pipes. This superficial management is leading to a huge waste of water, which is one of main causes of drought.

# Proposed solution
Our proposed solution consists of an interface through which it is possible to monitor the irrigation system. The user can know if a leakage is detected and where it is located, as well as the flow of water at the source site and the current humidity of the soil in correspondence of each solenoid valve. Another available information is the past irrigation schedule, with the relative periodical measurements of humidity of the soil (every hour). 

# Use cases 
Our system allows to do the following tasks:
* Leakages detection, quantification and localization
* Automated water flow regulation
* Water usage monitoring and management
